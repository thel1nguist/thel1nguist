- 👋 Hi, I’m @thel1nguist
- 👀 I’m interested in developing efficient tooling for ctfs and security assessments, as well as privacy-related educational and anti-tracking applications. In doing so, I aim to apply and fortify the knowledge I gain through self-study and certifications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Bash, C/C++, and x86 Assembly. 
- 💞️ I'd enjoy collaborating on anything fun, silly, or cool and simple that is security or privacy adjacent. My objective is to learn and realise my ideas in code, as well as automate to have to type and configure less.
